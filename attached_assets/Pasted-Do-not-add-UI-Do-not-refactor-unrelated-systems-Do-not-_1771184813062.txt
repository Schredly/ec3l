Do not add UI.
Do not refactor unrelated systems.
Do not introduce external integrations.

Objective:
Introduce a minimal, tenant-scoped workflow engine that executes metadata-defined workflows safely and audibly.

Instructions:

1) Add Workflow Metadata Models
   Introduce workflow definition models:

   - WorkflowDefinition
     - id
     - tenantId
     - name
     - triggerType (record_event | schedule | manual)
     - triggerConfig (json)
     - version
     - status (draft | active | retired)
     - createdAt

   - WorkflowStep
     - id
     - workflowDefinitionId
     - stepType (assignment | approval | notification | decision)
     - config (json)
     - orderIndex

2) Add Workflow Execution Models
   Introduce runtime execution tracking:

   - WorkflowExecution
     - id
     - tenantId
     - workflowDefinitionId
     - status (running | completed | failed)
     - startedAt
     - completedAt

   - WorkflowStepExecution
     - id
     - workflowExecutionId
     - workflowStepId
     - status (pending | completed | failed)
     - output (json)
     - executedAt

3) Execution Engine (Runner Only)
   Implement runner-side execution:

   - executeWorkflow(ctx, workflowDefinitionId, input)
   - Must require ModuleExecutionContext
   - Steps execute sequentially by orderIndex
   - Each step emits a WorkflowStepExecution record
   - Failures:
       - stop execution
       - mark workflow failed
       - record error artifact

4) Supported Step Types (v1)
   Implement minimal handlers:

   - assignment:
       - resolves assignee via config (user | group | rule stub)
       - records assignment result
   - approval:
       - creates approval task
       - pauses execution until approved/rejected
   - notification:
       - emits notification event (no delivery integration yet)
   - decision:
       - evaluates condition and controls next step

5) Change & Override Integration
   - WorkflowDefinition creation/modification:
       - creates Change record
       - follows validation + approval
   - Tenant overrides may:
       - patch WorkflowDefinition config
       - patch WorkflowStep config
   - Overrides do NOT mutate stored workflow definitions

6) Safety & Invariants
   - Only tenant execution contexts may execute workflows
   - SystemContext may inspect but not execute tenant workflows
   - Workflow execution must:
       - be tenant-scoped
       - be auditable
       - fail closed
   - No direct database mutation from step handlers

Constraints:
- No UI builders yet
- No async fan-out yet
- No external connectors yet
- No cross-tenant execution

Goal:
A minimal, safe workflow execution spine that supports assignment, approval, and notification, integrates with change management, and is overrideable without forks.
