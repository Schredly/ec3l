Do not build a full-blown page builder.
Do not refactor unrelated systems.
Keep UI minimal and premium-clean.

Objective:
Add a minimal Form Studio UI that supports targeted edits to compiled forms and saves changes as ModuleOverrides + Change records.

Instructions:

1) Add Form Studio Route + Page
   Create a UI page:
   - /studio/forms

   The page must support:
   - selecting tenant
   - selecting recordType
   - selecting formName
   - fetching compiled form JSON from:
       GET /tenants/:tenantId/forms/:recordTypeName/:formName/compiled
   - rendering sections + fields clearly

2) Targeted Editing (v1)
   Add simple controls (no drag/drop yet):
   - move field up/down within its section
   - move field to another section (dropdown)
   - toggle visible/readOnly/required when permitted
     - required toggle must respect schema-required invariant (cannot unset)

   The UI should maintain a local "working copy" of layout changes.

3) Save as Patch Override
   Implement an API endpoint:
   - POST /tenants/:tenantId/forms/:recordTypeName/:formName/overrides

   Request body includes:
   - changeSummary
   - patch operations (json)

   Server behavior:
   - create Change record
   - create ModuleOverride with overrideType="form"
   - validate patch using existing override validation rules
   - if validation passes:
       - mark override status = draft (do not auto-activate)
   - return overrideId + changeId

4) Activate Override (separate step)
   Implement:
   - POST /tenants/:tenantId/overrides/:overrideId/activate

   Behavior:
   - runs validation again
   - transitions override to active
   - updates Change status accordingly

5) Optional: "Vibe Patch" Assistant (minimal)
   Add a text box in the Form Studio:
   - user selects a target field or section
   - user describes desired change in natural language (e.g. "move phone field under email and make it required")
   - UI sends request to:
       POST /tenants/:tenantId/forms/:recordTypeName/:formName/vibePatch

   Server:
   - uses the agentic layer to propose patch operations ONLY
   - must NOT apply patch automatically
   - returns patch JSON to the UI for review and then Save

6) Safety & Constraints
   - All edits must produce patches + Change records
   - No direct writes to FieldDefinition / FormDefinition from UI
   - Respect tenant scope & RBAC placeholders (if RBAC not ready, use existing auth guard)
   - Keep design simple: two-pane view (form preview + edit controls)

Goal:
A minimal Form Studio that demonstrates isolated widget-level editing and AI-assisted patch generation, backed by overrides and change governance.
