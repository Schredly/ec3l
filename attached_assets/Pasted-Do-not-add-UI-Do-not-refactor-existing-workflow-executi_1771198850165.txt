Do not add UI.
Do not refactor existing workflow execution logic.
Do not introduce external integrations.

Objective:
Add tenant-scoped workflow triggers that safely initiate workflow executions from events and schedules.

Instructions:

1) Add Workflow Trigger Models
   Introduce trigger metadata:

   - WorkflowTrigger
     - id
     - tenantId
     - workflowDefinitionId
     - triggerType (record_event | schedule | manual)
     - triggerConfig (json)
     - status (active | disabled)
     - createdAt

2) Record Event Triggers (v1)
   Implement record-based triggers:
   - Supported events:
       - record.created
       - record.updated
   - triggerConfig must define:
       - recordType
       - optional fieldConditions
   - On matching event:
       - enqueue workflow execution intent
       - do NOT execute inline

3) Scheduled Triggers (v1)
   Implement schedule-based triggers:
   - triggerConfig includes:
       - cron or interval
   - Scheduler:
       - runs in control plane
       - emits execution intent at fire time
   - Scheduler must be:
       - tenant-scoped
       - idempotent
       - auditable

4) Manual Triggers
   - Allow workflows to be started manually via API:
       - tenant-scoped
       - permission-gated
       - auditable
   - Manual trigger emits execution intent, not execution

5) Execution Intent Queue
   Introduce a minimal execution intent mechanism:
   - WorkflowExecutionIntent
     - id
     - tenantId
     - workflowDefinitionId
     - triggerType
     - triggerPayload
     - createdAt
     - status (pending | dispatched | failed)

   - Runner consumes intents and:
       - executes workflow
       - updates intent status
       - links executionId

6) Safety & Invariants
   - Triggers:
       - cannot execute workflows directly
       - cannot bypass Change or override rules
       - must respect tenant isolation
   - SystemContext may register triggers
   - Only tenant execution contexts may dispatch execution
   - All trigger firings must be auditable

Constraints:
- No async fan-out
- No cross-tenant triggers
- No external event sources yet
- No UI

Goal:
Workflows can be safely initiated by record events, schedules, or manual actions via auditable, tenant-scoped trigger metadata.
