Do not add UI.
Do not refactor unrelated code.
Do not change existing template installation logic.

Objective:
Introduce tenant-scoped override layers that safely customize installed template modules without forking.

Instructions:

1) Add Tenant Override Models
   Introduce a new tenant-scoped override concept:

   - ModuleOverride
     - id
     - tenantId
     - installedModuleId
     - overrideType (workflow | form | rule | config)
     - targetRef (identifier of overridden element)
     - patch (json)
     - createdAt
     - createdBy
     - version
     - status (draft | active | retired)

2) Enforce Override Scope Rules
   - Overrides:
       - MUST reference an InstalledModule
       - MUST belong to the same tenant as the InstalledModule
       - MUST NOT reference Template or TemplateModule directly
   - Overrides are additive / patch-based only
   - Overrides cannot delete template behavior (only modify or extend)

3) Resolution Logic (Read-Time Composition)
   Update module resolution so that:
   - Runtime execution loads:
       TemplateModule baseline
       → InstalledModule config
       → Active ModuleOverrides (ordered by version)
   - Composition happens at execution time
   - No override mutates stored template state

4) Change Lifecycle Integration
   - Creating or modifying a ModuleOverride:
       - creates a Change record
       - follows existing validation + approval flow
   - Activating an override requires:
       - successful validation
       - status transition to "active"
   - Retiring an override leaves history intact

5) Safety & Enforcement
   - Only tenant-scoped execution contexts may create overrides
   - SystemContext may inspect but not create tenant overrides
   - Overrides must respect capability profiles
   - All enforcement remains fail-closed

Constraints:
- No template upgrades yet
- No override diff/merge UI
- No environment promotion yet
- No RBAC expansion yet

Goal:
Tenants can safely apply micro-changes to installed template modules using versioned, auditable patch layers without forks or privilege leakage.
